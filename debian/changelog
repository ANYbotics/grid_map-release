ros-jade-grid-map-cv (1.3.0-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Separated OpenCV to grid map conversions to grid_map_cv package. The new methods
    are more generalized, faster, and can be used without ROS message types.
  * Added new convenience function to change the resolution of grid maps with help of the OpenCV interpolation methods.
  * Added initializeFromImage() to GridMapCvConverter.
  * Added unit tests for grid_map_cv. Updated documentation.
  * Resolving build errors for OpenCV.
  * Fixed typo and added documentation.
  * Contributors: Peter Fankhauser, Dominic Jud,
